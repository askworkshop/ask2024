# Registration

This is primarily an invitation-based workshop. The registration is free, but the workshop will nevertheless provide lunches and coffee breaks. The registration is completed by exchanging emails, and an interested student/researcher working in the domain of Symmetric Key Cryptology is invited to send an email to "ask2024@googlegroups.com".

Since the workshop has limited capacity and funding, we may not be able to accept all the registration requests. The workshop reserves the right not to accept the registration request.
