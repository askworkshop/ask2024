Welcome to the home page of the **11th Asian Workshop on Symmetric Key Cryptography**. This workshop will be held for four days at TCG CREST Kolkata, India, starting on December 14th until December 17th, 2024. The workshop will be held just after [ASIACRYPT 2024](https://asiacrypt.iacr.org/2024/).

ASK has been held to promote research on symmetric-key cryptography in Asia since 2011. Broadly, the scope of the workshop includes, but is not limited to:

* Primitive design: block ciphers, stream ciphers, hash functions, (cryptographic) permutations, etc.
* Cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives.
* Provable Security: Design and analysis of the mode of operations - (authenticated) encryption schemes, message authentication codes, etc.
* Quantum Symmetric Cryptography.
* Implementation and Side Channel Analysis.
* Searchable Symmetric Encryption

The program will contain mainly two parts: **invited talks** in the mornings, and **group discussions** in the afternoons. For group discussions, we plan to have several small groups, and for each group, we aim to gather researchers who are all interested in one specific topic. The goal of the group discussion is to advance the collaborations within the research community and to find new results through discussions.
